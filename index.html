                        <li><strong>Principal UX Writer/Content Designer</strong> at Backbase – introduced content design to a fast-growing fintech</li>
                        <li><strong>VP Content Strategy</strong> at Barclaycard – shaped content for millions of customers</li>
                        <li><strong>Director of Content and Communication</strong> at Oradian – made financial inclusion technology more accessible</li>
                        <li><strong>Head of Content Strategy</strong> at Siegel & Gale – developed brand voice for global clients</li>
                        <li><strong>Founder and Director</strong> of Simplified and Narratology – consulted with organisations like PayPal, NS&I, and Old Mutual Wealth</li>

                    <p>I've collaborated internationally across Europe, the UK, South Africa, and the US. Whether it's helping a fintech find its voice or making legal content actually readable, I'm drawn to the hard problems where words really matter.</p>

                        <h4>Building from zero</h4>
                        <p>I introduced content design to Backbase. I created frameworks including principles, standards, guidelines, and acceptance criteria that teams actually wanted to use.</p>

                        <h4>Quality metrics</h4>
                        <p>I wrote and socialised quality standards. I made them a reality through  Definitions of Done in Jira, Figma widgets, and training sessions that helped teams know what "good" looks like.</p>

                        <p>With the support of Marketing, I  translated vague brand aspirations into three clear principles. These became the foundation for our UX design language. The work gave coherence to diverse teams.</p>

                        <h4>People-led processes</h4>
                        <p>I set up processes according to three pillars: Inspire, Guide and Support. This gave structure to our way of working, and set clear expectations for teams.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>As the first content hire, I hosted  office hours and created self-guided training sessions. My UX Writing courses became part of onboarding for designers.</p>

                        <h4>Content types</h4>
                        <p>I created detailed guidance, cheat sheets, and visual examples for confirmation prompts, errors, notifications, and more. I used varied formats to cater for diverse learning styles.</p>

                        <h4>Frameworks that scale</h4>
                        <p>I used a "Hum, Sing, Shout" framework for success messages. Hums confirm everyday tasks, Sings mark meaningful achievements, Shouts celebrate major milestones. The framework was adopted for by design and interaction teams across design patterns.</p>

                        <h4>Useful style guides </h4>
                        <p>I built copy style guides with both visual and textual guidance, with localised instances. I added Jira Definitions of Done so teams could check their own work. Engineers used the guides to automate checks with linting tools.</p>

                        <p>By plotting writing across tone parameters like power, relationship, and expertise, we communicate intention behind tone. This lifts tone from copywriting technique to strategic intent.</p>
